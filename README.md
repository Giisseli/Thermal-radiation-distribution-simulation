# Thermal-radiation-distribution-simulation
Simulates thermal radiation distribution from a flat source to another perpendicular plane based on thermal distribution of source.

Thermal radiation distribution simulation.m calculates heat flux from a flat source to another parallel plane based on thermal distribution in .csv format. 

View_Factor.m contains a function used in this simulation for calculating view factor between coaligned parallel rectangles.

1000Wpanel2.csv includes temperature distribution data of a high powered thermal radiation source.  This data was obtained with an infra-red camera.

Further instructions included in comments.
Use with MATLAB R2020b or newer.
